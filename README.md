# BoardGameInserts
3D printed board game insert design

This is a bit of a mess right now. I will be cleaning it up and organizing things sooner or later. 

The following inserts are "organized" and officially "published".

Frostpunk
Etherfields

If you stumble across this feel free to take anything here and do what you will with it. If you want to upload your own insert designs feel free, issue a PR and I will approve it. The only thing I ask is that you stick to OpenSCAD. 

If you have a game you want an insert for let me know, if I have it maybe I will design one. I mostly have nothing better to do when I am not playing games or reading rules.

If you find anything here useful a small donation would be appreciated, but of course not expected. I do this to help the board game community, not to make a living.
