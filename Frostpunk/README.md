# Frostpunk Insert

A custom insert because that iceberg box is just ridiculous and I will never carry it around.

This insert fits the base game content plus the Resource Expansion, The Frostlander Expansion and the Dreadnought mini in the base box. With this you can carry around Frostpunk with 2 boxes, the base box and either the Miniatures Expansion or the Timber CIty Expansion depending on whether you like wood or resin. And of course the playmat if you have that.

Printing parameters will depend on your printer, but I use a layer height of 0.2 mm, 4 layers bottom and top, a wall count of 4 and 30% infill. The boxes tend to pull up and warp on the corners so play around with our printer setting and first layer to make them stick. You can see in the pictures that I didn't total succeed in eliminationg all warping. Most of the time it is just aesthetic and doesn't effect the function. 

To pack this into the box there are four layers with most of the content being in the first layer.

## Layer 1

You can either cut the generator holder from the original insert like I did or you can come up with your own solution using foam or bubble wrap of whatever. The cutout from the original seems to work pretty good. The dreadnought is kept in it original tray but you will need to trim a little bit of one corner to fit the large buildings box (see Layers 2).

## Layer 2

Note the trimming needed to make the Large Buildings box fit.

## Layer 3

I used a couple of spacers to hold everything in place and then placed the bags for the hope and discontent markeres in one and the spare cardboard token that you don't need if you have the Frostlander Expansion in the other. Didn't seem like it was worth printing boxes for these but feel free to design some yourself.

## Layer 4

The boards fit with no lid lift, you have to play around with them a little bit but trust me they fit in there.
