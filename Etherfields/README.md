# Etherfields Insert

An insert for Etherfields. This insert will hold all the base content except the boss mini along with all the cards from all the expansions. It will not hold all the Scripts books (or the special plastic maps), but you only need one at a time anyway so you can swap the ones in that you need as you play through the campaigns. I put all the boss minis and the script books from the expansion campaigns in the stretch goals box.

I have replaced all the included dividers with printed dividers that are low profile to save a lot of space. 

For each of the players there are a set of dividers that allow you to store away your deck and remember where everything was.

The minis rattle around a bit in the boxes so if you are worried use some foam or bubble wrap.

The inserts accomodate sleeved cards for the most part. It will not fit all the secrets cards sleeved, I sleeve these as they are put into play, otherwise they are left unsleeved. The square tile cards are not sleeved, not even sure if sleeve for these cards exist.

Printing parameters will depend on your printer, but I use a layer height of 0.2 mm, 4 layers bottom and top, a wall count of 4 and 30% infill. The boxes tend to pull up and warp on the corners so play around with our printer setting and first layer to make them stick. You can see in the pictures that I didn't total succeed in eliminationg all warping. Most of the time it is just aesthetic and doesn't effect the function. 

To pack this into the box there are four layers with most of the content being in the first layer.

## Layer 1

This insert uses the tray for the small minis that came in the box. The player boards are just stored loose. The stands for the masks are stored wherever they fit in the Mask boxes.

## Layer 4

The board, manauals, card holders, etc all just fit on top of this last layer. There is a tiny bit of lid lift, maybe a few mm but it's not terrible.
