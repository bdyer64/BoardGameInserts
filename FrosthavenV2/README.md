# Frosthaven Insert

If you find anything here useful a small donation would be appreciated, but of course not expected. I do this to help the board game community, not to make a living.

A custom insert that includes Player Boxes and also allows you to fit everything back in the box. The original insert is fine but has some issues and doesn't allow you to organize monsters and other tokens in a way that makes sense (to me anyway). The couple aftermarket inserts are nice but neither of the ones I have seen allow you to also fit all the map tiles back into the box. Which isn't ideal if you aren't currently playing and want to store it away. 

All the card boxes fit sleeved cards. I used Mayday premium for both card sizes. If you use some other sleeves YMMV. You are free to modify anything here to fit the way you like.

Printing parameters will depend on your printer, but I use a layer height of 0.2 mm, 4 layers bottom and top, a wall count of 4 and 20% infill. The boxes tend to pull up and warp on the corners so play around with our printer setting and first layer to make them stick. You can see in the pictures that I didn't total succeed in eliminationg all warping. Most of the time it is just aesthetic and doesn't effect the function. 

To pack this into the box there are three layers of printed boxes and then a last layer of the board, rules, map tiles, etc. I have provided CAD produced images of each layer as well as a picture of my print fitted into the box.

## Obstacle Boxes

The obstacle box is a shameless ripoff of one of the aftermarket inserts you can buy. I'll assume that this is OK until someone comes after me and issues a cease and desist. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

The box is designed to with one box being the lid for the next until you get to the top where there is a proper lid.

I didn't put any labels in the obstacle box because there really is no sensible way to label everything. The pictures below show how all the obstacles and other cardboard tokens fit into the box.
