# Frosthaven Insert

If you find anything here useful a small donation would be appreciated, but of course not expected. I do this to help the board game community, not to make a living.

A custom insert that includes Player Boxes and also allows you to fit everything back in the box. The original insert is fine but has some issues and doesn't allow you to organize monsters and other tokens in a way that makes setup and teardown easy (to me anyway). The couple aftermarket inserts are nice but neither of the ones I have seen allow you to also fit all the map tiles back into the box. Which isn't ideal if you aren't currently playing and want to store it away. 

All the card boxes fit sleeved cards. I used Mayday premium for both card sizes. If you use some other sleeves YMMV. You are free to modify anything here to fit the way you like.

Printing parameters will depend on your printer, but I use a layer height of 0.2 mm, 4 layers bottom and top, a wall count of 4 and 20% infill. The boxes tend to pull up and warp on the corners so play around with our printer setting and first layer to make them stick. You can see in the pictures that I didn't total succeed in eliminationg all warping. Most of the time it is just aesthetic and doesn't effect the function. 

To pack this into the box there are three layers of printed boxes and then a last layer of the board, rules, map tiles, etc. I have provided CAD produced images of each layer as well as a picture of my print fitted into the box. 

## Layer 1

The character boxes are a bit of a tight fit, but they work fine all along the one edge. The 5 monster boxes are just stacked on top of each other. The one downside of this packing is that the boxes can be a little difficult to get out of the box. If you grab the large card box by the cutouts in its side and take it out first though the rest are pretty easy to get out.

## Layer 4 - 8

Put the map board in...

Put the spiral bound books in...

![Layer 5](https://github.com/bdyer64/BoardGameInserts/blob/main/FrosthavenV2/images/Layer5.jgp)

Put the rulebook, setup guide, alchemy chart, stickers, etc in. Jam the sealed puzzle book and elements board in here somewhere too...

![Layer 6](https://github.com/bdyer64/BoardGameInserts/blob/main/FrosthavenV2/images/Layer6.jpg)

Put the map tiles in. This is a bit of a puzzle and depending on how mucn time you spend optimizing it you mmay have a few mm of lid lift. Nothing too bad though.

Put the scenario flowcharts on top...

## Obstacle Boxes

The obstacle box is a shameless ripoff of one of the aftermarket inserts you can buy. I'll assume that this is OK until someone comes after me and issues a cease and desist. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

The box is designed to with one box being the lid for the next until you get to the top where there is a proper lid. 

![Obstacle Box](https://github.com/bdyer64/BoardGameInserts/blob/main/FrosthavenV2/Images/ObstacleBox0.jpg)

I didn't put any labels in the obstacle box because there really is no sensible way to label everything. The pictures below show how all the obstacles and other cardboard tokens fit into the box.

## Monster Boxes

The monster boxes are also ripped of from an aftermarket insert, but I improved them by adding labels. 

Each box is labeled on the bottom of the compartment:

As well as on the lid:

This will make it really easy to find the monsters you need for any given scenerio. There are 5 monster boxes and they just stack on top of each other in the box. The one monster box is a little different. It's middle row contains the various monsters that share cards with other monsters of that type (scouts, imps, priests).

## Player Boxes

There are 4 player boxes that should have plenty of room to store your current ability cards, current modifier cards, all your currently unavailable cards and all the cardboard tokens associated with each character. You can also fit the dials, character board and character status sheets in the box.

## Small Cards Box

The Small Cards Box holds all the small cards that aren't stored elsewhere. All the compartments are labelled except for the little compartment at the back left, this is for the Radmon Scenario cards. There are printed dividers to replace ones that come with the game since they stick up too far. File all the unavailable Itmes, Portions and Town Guard Cards behind the Unavailable divider. Everything in front of the Unavailable marker is Available. There is a Completed divider to file the completed challenges behind.

## Large Cards Box

The Large Cards Box holds all the large cards that aren't player/character specific. All the compartments are labelled. There are printed dividers to replace the ones that came with the game since they stick up too far. There are dividers to file Unvailable and Removed cards behind. Cards in front of the Unavailable dividier are Available.

## Other Boxes

For the rest of the boxes it should be fairly apparent how to pack them, but here are a bunch of pictures to help out.

### Status Tokens

### Monster Stat Cards

The cards in the bottom of this box are the Monster and Ally attack modifier decks.

### Plastic Bases

### Minis Box

### Envelopes Box

In order to make everything fit I had to make the lid of the envelope box thinner. It's a little flimsier than I would like but it works OK and you don't have to open this box very often so it should be OK. I might try a box that the envelopes slide in from the side, but for now this works.

### Other Card Boxes

Various other cards fit into these 3 boxes. The boxes were printed bigger than the size of the cards so they fit into the box without sliding around. It takes slightly more plastic but I think it's worth it.
